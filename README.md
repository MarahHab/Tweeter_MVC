##  Tweeter Project üê¶
Welcome to the Tweeter MVC project! This web application is a simplified version of a Twitter-like platform, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery**. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure a clean and organized codebase. 

## „Ä∞Ô∏è Project Structure
The project is organized using the **MVC** architecture: 
- **Model**: The data and logic of the application reside in the  model. In this project, it manages the data, such as tweets, user information, and interactions. 
- **View**: The user interface and presentation layer are handled by the view. HTML and CSS files define the structure and style, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience. 
- **Controller**: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It processes user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view accordingly. JavaScript and jQuery are used for controller functionalities.
